Created for the community project ["HMS Luminary"][hms-luminary], for [Jelly Hoshiumi][jelly-hoshiumi]'s 2026 birthday.

I was originally approached to make a [“Luminary”][luminary]-inspired spoof of the [Star Trek intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p5kcBxL7-qI) (which eventually became the "Luminous Frontier" track),
but after watching a draft of the flight video, I just had to score the rest of it. The team did an amazing job on this all around. Happy birthday, Jelly!

The score was created with [MuseScore 4](https://musescore.org/) and rendered with Muse Sounds.  
Album art by [Edengarde](https://x.com/Edengarde_Q).  
“Luminary” was composed by Singto Conley.
